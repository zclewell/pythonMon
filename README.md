# pythonMon
I was playing pokemon and started thinking about OOP so I decided to make a battle simulator to practice!

# use
You can run battle.py to simulate a single turn of a Charizard vs. a Charizard (very interesting). Hopefully will introduce a command line environment eventually

# scope
Starting with pokemon I like and their respective moves. Might write a bot to scrape and auto generate the classes based on bulbapedia or some other source.
